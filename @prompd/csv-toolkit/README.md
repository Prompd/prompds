## Features
- **Sorting CSV Data:** Easily sort your CSV files based on any column.
- **Distinct Values:** Remove duplicate entries to get unique values from your datasets.
- **Sample Data Contexts:** Includes sample CSV files to demonstrate the toolkit's functionality.

## Usage
Once installed, you can utilize the provided prompts to manipulate your CSV data. Below are examples of how to use the main functionalities:

### Sorting CSV Data
To sort a CSV file, you can use the `csv-sort.prmd` prompt. This allows you to specify the column to sort by and the sort direction.

### Removing Duplicates
With the `csv-sort-and-distinct.prmd` prompt, you can both sort your data and remove duplicate entries in one go.

## Sample Data
The toolkit comes with sample CSV files located in the `contexts` directory, which can be used for testing and demonstration purposes:

- `sample-data.csv`: A basic CSV file with non-duplicate entries.
- `sample-data-with-duplicates.csv`: A CSV file containing duplicate entries for testing the distinct functionality.
