| - **Metrics**: The lead has provided some details on the expected business impact, but we need to quantify the       |
| specific metrics and financial value that our solution could deliver.                                                |
| - **Economic Buyer**: The contact's role is not clearly defined as a decision maker or economic buyer. We need to    |

| understand the specific problems they are trying to solve.                                                           |
| - **Champion**: There is no clear internal advocate identified who can champion our solution within the              |
| organization.                                                                                                        |
