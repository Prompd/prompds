|                                                                                                                      |
| ## 1. Overview                                                                                                       |
| The objective of this report is to provide a structured analysis of the various API testing strategies that can be   |
| employed to ensure the quality and reliability of application programming interfaces (APIs). APIs are the backbone   |
| of modern software systems, enabling seamless integration and data exchange between different components and         |
| services. Effective API testing is crucial to identify and address issues early in the development lifecycle,        |
| ultimately delivering high-performing and secure APIs.                                                               |
|                                                                                                                      |
