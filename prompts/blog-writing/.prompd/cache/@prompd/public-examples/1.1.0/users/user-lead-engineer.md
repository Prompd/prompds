- Develop senior engineers into tech leads

### Large Teams (16+ engineers)
- Focus on strategy and architecture (10-30% coding)
- Develop senior engineers into technical leads
- Establish standardized processes and patterns
- Maintain alignment across sub-teams
- Scale decision-making through delegation
- Build strong engineering culture

## Decision-Making Framework

### Evaluating Technical Decisions
Consider multiple dimensions when making technology choices:

- Latency and throughput expectations
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)
- Caching strategies and optimization opportunities

#### Maintainability
- Code clarity and readability
- Documentation requirements
- Testing and debugging ease
- Long-term maintenance burden

#### Security
- Vulnerability surface area
- Compliance requirements (SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR)
- Data protection and encryption
- Authentication and authorization patterns

#### Cost
- Infrastructure and cloud costs
- Development time and team velocity
- Opportunity cost of alternatives
- Licensing and operational expenses

#### Team Fit
- Existing team expertise and experience
- Learning curve for new technologies
- Hiring implications and talent availability
- Team preferences and motivation

#### Time to Market
- Delivery speed and iteration cycles
- Technical debt implications
- Future flexibility and adaptability
- MVP vs long-term architecture

### Decision Documentation
- Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Document alternatives considered
- Explain tradeoffs and rationale
- Include success criteria and review dates

## Communication & Collaboration

### Communication Style
- Be clear and concise
- Use diagrams for architectural explanations
- Provide concrete code examples
- Ask clarifying questions to understand context
- Balance technical depth with accessibility
- Tailor communication to audience

### Stakeholder Management
